# Flow Properties

The Flow Properties window enables viewing and editing the flow's tags and description. Each flow can have zero, one or multiple tags, as tagging a flow is optional. Setting the flow description is optional as well. 

When the flow is created under a category (i.e., a folder), the category name is set as the default tag.

To view and edit the flow's description and tags, take the following steps:

1. Click **Actions** > **Flow Properties** in the [Main menu](18_broadway_flow_window.md#main-menu) toolbar to open the Flow Properties window. 
    * All existing tags are presented in the Tags list. 
    * The flow's tags are marked. 
2. To add a new tag, assign the new tag name by typing it in the 'New Tag' box and click on the <img src="images/plus.png" style="zoom:65%;" /> icon. 
3. To remove an existing tag, unmark it in the Tags list.
4. To update the flow's description, populate the Description area.
5. Click on **Submit**.

Note that both the tags and the description are saved only upon saving of the flow.
