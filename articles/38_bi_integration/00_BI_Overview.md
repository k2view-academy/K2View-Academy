# BI User Guide Overview

Fabric provides a built-in integration with [Exago BI](https://support.exagoinc.com/hc/en-us) - external BI system that enables the design and execution of reports and dashboards. 

Exago BI can be accessed from the [K2View Web Framework](https://support.k2view.com/Academy_6.5/articles/30_web_framework/01_web_framework_overview.html) whereas two applications are included there:

* **BI Admin**, for the system configuration and initial setup. Only the users that have a BI Admin or BI Designer permission assigned to their role can access this module.
* **BI Designer**, for the creation and generation of the reports. Any user can access this module however the access to various content elements (folders, reports, etc.) within this application can be restricted by setting up the permission rules. 

Prior to starting your work on the reports, perform the following setup steps:

* [Installation and Storage Management setup](01_Installation.md).
* [Access rules and permissions settings](02_Permissions_Setup.md).
* [Metadata setup and parameters definition](03_Metadata_Setup).

Each of these steps is described in details in subsequent articles.
