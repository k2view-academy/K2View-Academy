## PII Discovery Introduction

The Discovery Matching Rules function of the DPM system lets you search databases of all systems within the company for personal data that may require protection due to privacy legislation. You can create rules to either match or exclude data during a database search, configure regular expression (RegEx) for the selection of schema and table patterns to match or exclude, and view the discovery results using an array of filters.
