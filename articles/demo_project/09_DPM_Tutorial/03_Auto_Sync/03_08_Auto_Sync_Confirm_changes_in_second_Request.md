## Confirm Change Captured in the Second Request

Review the information provided to you by DPM in the results of the second DSAR Request. The updated city and phone number you had entered in the OSB system should appear in the new DSAR results. 

This demonstrated that changes to the source systems are automatically captured by the DPM system and are reflected in the results of DSARs without the need for separate synchronization process.
