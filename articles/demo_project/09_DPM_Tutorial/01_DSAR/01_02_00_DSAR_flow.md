# Create a DSAR Flow

In this section, we will configure the DSAR Flow. As described at the DPM User Guide [Flows](/articles/DPM/02_Admin_Module/03_Flows.md) chapter, each Flow is composed of one or more sequential Stages, and each Stage is composed of one or more Tasks. Those Tasks are the bricks that create the DSAR fulfilment process. The following lists some of the multiple ways that Tasks can be configured.

A Task can:

- Be configured to run in parallel or sequential to another Task
- Be manual or automatic
- Be conditional to the results of another Task
- Use inputs from a previous Task
- Receive input from the Customer at the moment of Request submission

The creation of Flows using the K2View DPM System provides limitless flexibility. The DSAR Flow we will create in this section includes several Tasks as an example of Flow configuration; however, when you configure the Flows as part of your own project, you can implement any number of Tasks and sequence according to your needs.  

**Note**: This section assumes you followed the login steps in the previous section of this tutorial, and you are now looking at the DPM Admin main screen. The menu on the left side of the screen is the Admin menu.
