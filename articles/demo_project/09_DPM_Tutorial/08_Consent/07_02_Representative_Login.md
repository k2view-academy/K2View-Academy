### Login to the System

Enter the DPM application using a user that has Representative credentials.

For the purpose of the tutorial we have created a user called "rep".

Click **Login**.

Once a user logs into the DPM system as a Representative, the screen is updated with two frames (windows) of information. The left frame displays a list of menu options for this module. The right frame displays the interactive components of the selection. The Requests List screen displays by default after logging into the system as a Representative.
