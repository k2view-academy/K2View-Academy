## Customer Consent Management Tutorial

Each customer can set consent preferences by accessing the Consent Management menu option from the Customer menu.

When accessing this menu option, the customer can review the list of consents, define whether to opt-in or opt-out to each one, or view historical information about opting-in or opting-out of previously performed activities.

The following simulation of working within DPM Consent Management will show you how to log in, opt-in or opt-out of Consents, and view the history of Consent actions.
