## Login to the System as a Customer

For this tutorial, enter the user credentials that were provided to you upon registration, to access the DPM system with a Customer role.

In our example: 

**Username** - anabelle

**Password** - k2view

<img src="../images/anabelle_login.png" width="30%" height="30%">                                  

Click **Login**.

Once a user logs into the DPM system as an Customer, the Customer landing page displays by default. If the user has additional roles attributed, as in the case of Anabelle Deleon, the landing page may be different as a result.
