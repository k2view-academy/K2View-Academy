## Ensure Your Request is Marked Complete

After a Customer submits a new request for **Data Rectification**, the next step in the process takes place on the **Requests List** screen. This screen lets the Customer review the case progress while the system automatically updates data based upon rectification policies configured for this activity. The Customer should wait for the activities to be completed, and they can follow that progress on the Requests List screen. When the Request is marked Complete, the Customer data has been successfully rectified in the system.
