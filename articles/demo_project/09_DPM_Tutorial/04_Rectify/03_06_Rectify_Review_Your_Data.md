## Review Rectified Data in the Source Systems

Once your rectification request status was marked **Complete**, it means that data relating to the Customer is now rectified in all the Source Systems that were integrated with DPM. For this tutorial, access the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes. Search these systems to view your customer's data and confirm that the requested information was rectified.

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".
