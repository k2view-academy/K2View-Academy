# Templates Overview

Templates are ready-made Fabric objects that can be used throughout a project. Working with a defined built-in structure rather than creating an object from scratch, saves time and increases efficiency. Templates can also reduce implementation errors since they use and embed the correct methodologies and Fabric’s best practices.

Templates can be used for various purposes in Broadway flows and actors, Java files, Graphit and the Data Catalog.

Fabric Templates support the usage of placeholders for smoother and smarter reuse. When creating an object based on a template, the user populates the template’s placeholders so that the new object is auto-generated with the data that is already embedded in the created object.

The integrated Templates engine has powerful capabilities like iteration over lists, conditions and lookup expressions. 

Templates can be used in many scenarios. For example, in TDM they are heavily employed in Broadway flows to transfer data from LU tables into target tables. Here the same template is used to create broadway flows which fit to all LU tables, instead of manually creating a flow for each LU table.
