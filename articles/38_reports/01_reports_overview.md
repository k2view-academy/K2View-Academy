# Reports Overview

Fabric includes a **Reports** application, which enables building interactive pixel-perfect reports. This application supports data binding to a wide range of JSON data sources, by providing a flexible connection configuration to a REST API endpoint.

Fabric's **Reports** is a lightweight reporting solution, implemented using the 3rd party application - *ActiveReportsJS by Mescious* - which is embedded into the [K2View Web Framework](/articles/30_web_framework/01_web_framework_overview.md) and Fabric Web Studio. The *ActiveReportsJS* license is included within Fabric license. No separate installation or configuration is required. 

Fabric's **Reports** application includes a Designer and a Viewer components:

* **Designer** - enables creating a report template, including the following: 
  - Definition of data sources, data sets and parameters.
  - Binding the report's elements to the data set's fields.
  - Designing the report's layout (fonts, colors, borders, etc). 
* **Viewer** - enables generating a report, including the following:
  - Generating the report's preview.
  - Searching for data within the preview file.
  - Downloading the extract files. The supported formats are: PDF, HTML and CSV.

Access to the Designer component is available via Fabric Web Studio only. Access to the Viewer component is available via the Web Framework application's list.
