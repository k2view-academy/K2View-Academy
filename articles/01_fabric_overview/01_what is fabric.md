# What is Fabric?

<a href="https://www.k2view.com/products/data-fabric/" target="_blank">Data Fabric</a> is a data product management platform that provides access to data where and when you need it. 
Fabric solves real-time operational needs for data that is stored and handled in different systems, technologies or geo-locations. 

Acting as a data layer above existing data sources, Fabric controls data using a patented Micro DB offering multiple and diverse built-in integrated data management capabilities for end-to-end management of the data lifecycle.

### What is a Micro DB?
K2view uniquely manages all the data hold for a business entity (a specific customer, device, order, etc.) in its own high-performance, compressed, and encrypted Micro-Database â€“ one for each instance of a business entity. Each entity is synced, processed and stored separately, on demand. The Micro-Database is then instantly accessible by any authorized data consumer via SQL, API, CDC, messaging or streaming. 

By adopting this revolutionary approach to operational data management, Fabric avoids the standard pains like: querying massive, siloed DBs and then unifying, processing, and delivering the data via rigid and complex batch processes that are costly to build, run and maintain.

### Key Fabric Features
* Modern and distributed architecture that **provides linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance** on commodity hardware and cloud infrastructures.
* Data replication capabilities across nodes and data centers that **provide customers with the peace of mind, knowing they can survive node failures or regional outages**.
* Patented MicroDB, a data lake for each business entity instance, that provides unparalleled performance with standard SQL queries.
* Patented data security approach, every MicroDB is encrypted individually, **providing the peace of mind that massive data breaches are prevented**.
* Unique near-data-logic architecture that **enables millisecond performance and throughput for APIs**. 
* Built-in integrated drag-and-drop data management capabilities to enable a **time-to-market that is measured in days to weeks and not weeks to months**.  

To summarize, Fabric architecture yields significant savings in computing, power and storage, a fact that makes it a perfect data platform for mission-critical, operational and real-time use cases.
