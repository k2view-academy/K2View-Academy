# User Dashboard

When a customer logs into the DPM user interface, the first screen displayed is the Customer Dashboard. The Dashboard includes the following items:

- Submit a Request: button used to submit a request.
- My Open Requests: displays the number of requests processing for this customer.
- View Requests: expands to view the list of the customer’s requests.

The same options can be reached also from the menu items on the left side of the screen.
