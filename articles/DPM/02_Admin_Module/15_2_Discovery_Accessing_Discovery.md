## Accessing Discovery Matching Rules

There are three activity phases in the Discovery Matching Rules function.

- Define a set of rules to use for the PII discovery process.
- Define interfaces (systems and databases you can connect to search for PII data).
- Execute the discovery and review the results to determine which actions to take for each field indicated by the discovery process.

Matching Rules are configured by accessing the Discovery Matching Rules menu option.
