# DPM Main Menu

The DPM Main Menu is the starting point of every user action. It is located on the left side of the screen. The main menu options represent the different DPM Application Roles, such as: Representative, Case Owner, Supervisor, Steward, Customer or Admin.

Each user will see only the Application Roles which were enabled to his Corporate Role. The options that are presented to each user depend on the DPM Application roles granted to that user: 

- Each Corporate Role can have multiple Application Roles assigned to it (see Role Management chapter).
- Each user is assigned one or more Corporate Roles (see User Management chapter). 
- The DPM system identifies the list of DPM application Roles that are enabled for each of those Corporate Roles assigned to the user and builds the list of Main Menu options accordingly. 

Take for example a user that was assigned two Corporate Roles:

- Corporate Role that has the “Steward” Application Role assigned to it.
- Corporate Role that has the “Case Owner” Application Role assigned to it.

The Main Menu items that will be presented to this user would be both the Steward and the Case Owner menus.

The order that the menu options are presented is defined according to the order that the Corporate Roles were assigned to the user. For the above example, the Corporate Role that has the Case Owner Application Role enabled to it was assigned to this user first, and only next was the Corporate Role that represents the Steward Application Role assigned.
