# DPM Configuration

**Overview**

As described in the first chapter, the Admin module is where the DPM Administrator can define the support for the different Privacy Regulations and their respective Activities.
The configuration is comprised of:

•	Define Flows: The Flows specify the set of tasks that are required for the fulfillment of a customer request.

•	Define Regulation and Activities: Configure the Regulation and Activities that the DPM supports. Once an Activity is defined, then map the Activity to the corresponding Flow.
