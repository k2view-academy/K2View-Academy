# Roles management

## Roles management Overview

The DPM is a role-based application. Each user is associated with one or more roles. The role determines the Activities the user can perform in the system.
The roles are structured in two layers: 

- DPM Application Roles – each application role includes a set of DPM functionality a user can perform.
- Corporate Roles – Configurable roles defined by the corporation to represent the corporate organizational structure for DPM users. Each user to take part in one of the DPM Activities is first assigned to a Corporate role. 

For a user to perform a specific Activity in the DPM, the user is assigned to a Corporate Role enabled by the Application Role where the Activity is included.

Upon login, the system identifies the user’s Corporate role and the associated DPM Application Role. The user is granted access only to the functionality defined for their role.
The Admin module allows the DPM Administrator to define the relationship between users, Corporate defined roles and the functions assumed in the DPM system.
