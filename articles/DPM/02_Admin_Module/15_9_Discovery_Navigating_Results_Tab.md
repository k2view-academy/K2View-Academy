## Navigating the Results Tab

After the DPM system has searched the databases of all systems within the company for PII data, you can search within the Discovery Results at a detailed level. The Results tab displays these details, letting you narrow down the list by a number of filters. You can manage the Results List view in a variety of ways using the drop-down lists along the top of the screen. 

**Note**: If you know the Discovery ID of the Request you submitted, you can manually enter it into the **Discovery ID** field. This is the only search option that does not provide a drop-down list of choices.

### Filtering Results

For demonstration purposes, we will narrow down the Results list to only display returns of one parameter. 

Click the **Column** drop-down list.

You can either enter select a Column name by scrolling through the drop-down list, or you can enter a search term. The scope of the Results list narrows after each letter or number you enter into the field. For this example, we will enter **email** into the **Column** drop-down search field.

You can observe that the options in the drop-down list change to only include the letter(s) or number(s) you entered into the field. 

Enter your search criteria and select a parameter that displays in the list. The Results List displays all discovery search returns that contain a **Column** name pattern containing **email**.
