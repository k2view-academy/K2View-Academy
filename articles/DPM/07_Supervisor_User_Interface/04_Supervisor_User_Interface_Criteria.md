### Assignment Criteria 

The Assignment Criteria is defined in the lower section of the Resource Management screen:

The assignment criteria provide the ability to define who are the Case Owners that are responsible for a specific Regulation or for a specific Activity under this Regulation. 
If the option that is selected is  ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_53_a_divide_equaly_icon.png), it means no special criteria should be used, and the system will simply follow the assignment method that was selected in the upper section of the screen (see previous sub-chapter).

To activate the option to define Case Owners per Regulation, select the option  ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_53_b_divide_by_regulation_icon.png). This present to the user the list of regulations active in the DPM system and allows to define for each Regulation one or more users that can be allocated to Requests opened for this Regulation. In the example above, CCPA Requests would be allocated only to the Case Owner called “John Blake”, the GDPR Requests can be allocated to either “John Blake” or “Linda Pie”, and HAWAII_SB418 Requests can be allocated to any Case Owner. 

To define who are the users that are allocated to each Regulation, click the line of the Regulation you want to configure. The system opens a pop-up screen that allows to select one or more of the Case Owner users.

The next level of assignment criteria is the  ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_54_a_filter_by_activity_icon.png). When this option is switched on, the supervisor can define additional assignment criteria at the Activity level. In the example above, every Request of the Regulation CCPA and Activity “What Do You Collect on Me” will be allocated to the Case Owner user called “Linda Pie”. 
To add new assignment criteria at the Activity level, use the  ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_54_b_new_filter_icon.png) option at the right side of the screen. This opens a pop-up screen where the supervisor can select the Regulation, Activity and one or more Case Owners that should be responsible for the Requests of this kind.
