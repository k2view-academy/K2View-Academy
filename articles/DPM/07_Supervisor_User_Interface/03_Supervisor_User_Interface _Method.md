The supervisor can select if new Requests would be allocated to Case Owners based on:

- Round Robin assignment – New Requests are allocated to the Case Owners in turns. With this assignment method all the Case Owners are assigned an equal share of the Requests.
- The Least Loaded – New Requests are allocated to the Case Owner that has the smallest number of open Requests.
