# Supervisor User Interface

The Supervisor role oversees the overall DPM process.  
A Supervisor can:

- View the Requests Dashboard 
- View the Requests List 
- Configure new Requests allocation policy to a Case Owner

## Supervisor Requests Dashboard

The Supervisor Dashboard is equal to the Case Owner Dashboard. For additional information, refer to the [Case Owner](/articles/DPM/06_Case_Owner_User_Interface/02_Case_Owner_User_Interface_Dashboard.md) section.

## Supervisor Requests List

The Supervisor Request List and subsequent Request Details and Task Details screens are the same screen as presented to the [Case Owner](/articles/DPM/06_Case_Owner_User_Interface/01_Case_Owner_User_Interface_List.md).
