# Advanced Configuration

<web>

### Web Studio

* The ```Implementation/SharedObjects/Interfaces/Discovery/``` folder in the Project tree is a folder that holds all Catalog and Discovery process-related configuration files:

  * The **MTable** subfolder holds the MTables used by the Catalog's various processes. In addition, when [Build Artifacts](09_build_artifacts.md) is performed, the Catalog artifact file called **catalog_field_info.csv** is also created in this folder.
  * The **plugins.discovery** is a configuration file that defines a list of plugins and their execution order. Starting Fabric V8.0,  the file exists in this location only when project-level overrides have been performed. Click [here](/articles/39_fabric_catalog/04_plugin_framework.md) for more details about this file.

* *Show Catalog Commands* is a Web Studio setting that either shows or hides the Catalog's related commands **Run Discovery Job** and **Open in Catalog** in the Web Studio. 

  * By default, *Show Catalog Commands* is enabled. 
  * This setting can be updated using the [Web Studio's user preferences](/articles/04_fabric_studio/04_user_preferences.md). 

</web>

### Catalog Application Configuration

The **properties-info.json** is a configuration file used by the Catalog Application to determine the view and behavior of various Catalog application elements. This JSON file defines for example:
* Which properties are editable (via [manual override](07_manual_overrides.md)) in the Properties tab;
* Which properties are searchable via the [Advanced Search](08_search_catalog.md#advanced-search) screen.

The file is located in ```fabric/staticWeb/catalog``` folder.

<web>

In order to perform the project-level overrides in the **properties-info.JSON** file:

* Create a **catalog** folder under the **Web** folder of the **Web Services** LU and copy the file into it.

* After updating the file, save it and deploy the LUs.

### General

NEO4J_SERVER_MEMORY_HEAP_MAX_SIZE_MB parameter in the [data_discovery] section of config.ini specifies the maximum heap size for the Neo4j server. By default, it is set to 2048 Mb. 

* The Neo4j heap size is set when starting Neo4j in a space. 
* This value can be adjusted, based on the data platform size and the number of schemas. For example, when an expected data platform size is large, it is recommended to increase this setting. 
* To update the heap size in an existing space, stop Neo4j and the DATA_DISCOVERY_JOB, update this setting in config.ini and run the Discovery Job.

ENABLE_DATA_DISCOVERY is a hidden configuration parameter that defines whether the Discovery should be enabled in the system (if neo4j is part of the Fabric space). By default it is set to true. If the Fabric space doesnâ€™t include *neo4j*, ENABLE_DATA_DISCOVERY should be added to this section and set to false.
