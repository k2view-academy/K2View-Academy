### Develop on Fabric with IntelliJ
Fabric Studio has been fully integrated with IntelliJ . 

It is mostly recommended if you frequently develop Java functions; you will then benefit from the most advanced code-writing and debugging capabilities available in the market.  

Using IntelliJ will be particularly helpful to debug the following types of programs:

- Enrichment functions
- Web services
- Java classes for new Broadway actors
