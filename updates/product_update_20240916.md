### The TDM 9.1 Official Release

TDM 9.1 has just been released and it includes the following new features/capabilities:

* **Parameters Coupling,** the previous versions, until now, were able to support isolated business parameters in a param search. However, per the newly added ***parameters coupling\*** capability, multiple parameters can be taken into account and joined, for an optimized param search that leads to intersection finding.
* **Table Level Task Enhancements,** supporting **custom logic** on selected tables. A custom flow can be added to extract, load or delete of a table.
* **Adding Input Parameters for Pre and Post Execution Processes,** enabling the task creator to send input parameters to the taskâ€™s pre and/or post execution processes.
