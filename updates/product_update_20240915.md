### The Fabric 8.1 Official Release

We are happy to announce that Fabric 8.1.0 has just been released and it includes the following:

* The **Catalog masking actors** have been enhanced to mask sensitive data within complex structures, when data is stored in Fabric or provisioned to target database.
* The Discovery now supports **parsing of arrays**. In addition, **split and combine Catalog artifacts** is now supported, which helps combining outputs of several teams. 
* **Broadway** now includes new actors and editors **to interact with LLM**.
* In the Web Studio, the **LU Schema** creation has been enhanced to **create multiple populations** for the same LU table in case of multiple parents or multiple FKs.
* The **Configuration** tab has been added in the **Admin** which enables changing the config.ini file.
* **AWS Secret Manager**, supports now access by IAM role/service account, instead of providing access ID and secret.
* The **Batch** can run now on instances from a Broadway flow, listening to a message queue.
* Fabric now supports system DB secrets stored in external Secret Manager.
